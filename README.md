# acceleration-recorder-android
Android client for the Acceleration Stream. The app will receive the acceleration data sent
by the [corresponding Pebble WatchApp](https://github.com/moopat/acceleration-stream-pebble) and persist it in a database so it can be transmitted to a server or downloaded
as CSV later on. If you only need CSV export for the last few samples consider using [acceleration-stream-android](https://github.com/moopat/acceleration-stream-android) of which
this project is a fork of.
